**Instructions**

Create divs dynamically using jQuery.


**Expected results**

When the button is pressed in the browser, a new div should be generated on the page. Each div should contain:

1. Some simple content (such as a sentence or small image) so that it can be easily seen and
2. Some simple CSS to style each div (such as text color). (Hint: Use jQuery's css property to do so.)


NOTE: Do not write <div> tags directly into the HTML body.

Make sure to skim over the jQuery properties listed on jQuery's main docs home page: https://api.jquery.com/. Use this list or a search engine to find appropriate jQuery properties to use in your code.
